#Project: Backgrounds and Gradients (with Apple)

######Project Overview
In this project you'll clone the website of one of the most design-forward companies in the world. It's not a very complex site but it uses background photos well and the navbar at the top contains a gradient that you should be able to mimic.

This is a project from [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com) HTML/CSS course [Backgrounds and Gradients](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients?ref=lnav).
