#Google Maps API

This project is was completed as part of the [Javascript Course](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/putting-google-maps-onto-your-site) at [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com). The instructions were to add a Google map to a web page and and drop a marker on the current location. Add a form for users to input different coordinates to display another location. I also added a title to the marker, and the message from the user, making it display the current coordinates and user message on hover.

[Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/krjordan/Google-Map/blob/master/index.html) the website. The site is best viewed in Chrome and it might be slow to load due to it loading on an html preview site.
