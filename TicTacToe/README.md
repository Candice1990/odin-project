# Tic Tac Toe

I have written two versions of Tic Tac Toe. One is written in HTML, SASS, and Javascript/jQuery and the other is written in Ruby. Both of these projects were completed while working through The Odin Project's online curriculum. 

The HTML version can be viewed [here](http://krjordan.github.io/TicTacToe).

The JavaScript/jQuery project details can be found [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/tic-tac-toe).

The Ruby project details can be found [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/oop).

Sample gameplay for the Ruby version:
