# Slider

This is a slider that automatically goes to the next slide every 5 seconds. The user can hover over the slider to display arrows to change to the next or previous slide as well as click on the small circles under the slider. 

This project was also submitted as my solution to [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com) assignment [Creating An Image Slider](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/creating-an-image-carousel-slider). 

[Preview](https://rawgit.com/krjordan/slider/master/index.html) the website. The site is best viewed in Chrome and it might be slow to load due to it loading on an html preview site.
