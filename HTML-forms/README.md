# HTML Forms (Mint.com clone)

The first half of this project was completed as part of The Odin Project's online HTML/CSS curriculum. The purpose of the project was to get familiar with HTML and CSS by cloning the Mint.com sign up form. The instructions can be found [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/html-forms).

The second half of this project was completed as part of the JavaScript/jQuery online curriculum. The purpose was implement a way to validate input on the client-side. I chose to use jQuery's validation plug-in. The instructions to this part of the project can be found [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/validating-a-form-with-jquery).
