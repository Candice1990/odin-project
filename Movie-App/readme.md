#Movie-App

This is a desktop movie app that allows the user to search by keywords and titles. The app uses the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/). It can also randomly pull ten entries from the database on page scroll. 

The project was submitted as my project solution to [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com). The project instructions can be found [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/infinite-scroll-and-submitting-a-form-with-ajax?ref=lnav).

The app can be viewed [here](http://krjordan.github.io/Movie-App).
