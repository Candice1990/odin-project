# Mastermind Game

This is a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computer's random code. There is also an option to pick the colors and play against the computer.

This is my solution to a project from [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com).You can check out the project [instructions here](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/oop).
