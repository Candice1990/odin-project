# Project: Building An On Screen Calculator Using Javascript

This is an onscreen calculator made with JavaScript. The user can click the buttons to perform the math problems and the solution is displayed in the input field. This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com) [JavaScript course](http://www.theodinproject.com/javascript-and-jquery/on-screen-calculator) curriculum. The warmup exercise is also located in this repo. 

The calculator can be viewed [here](http://krjordan.github.io/calculator).
